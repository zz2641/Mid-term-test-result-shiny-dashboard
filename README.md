# Midterm-Result-Interactive-Dashboard

This is a shiny dashboard project. It displayed a comprehensive picture of how a mid-term quiz is designed and how students performed from both individual and aggregate perspectives. The plots are intuitive to tell the potential users the following stories:

## General:
1. Topic(s) tested in each item
2. Frequency of topics being tested
3. Item Difficulty(defined by classical testing theory) and Distribution

## Individual:
1. Time spent on each question and how it changes in question order
2. Click count on each question and how it changes in question order
3. Mastery of topics tested in the quiz
(p.s all the questions were labeled correct or wrong according to individual test results, so users could identify the key items quickly and conduct deeper analysis of reasons for success or failure)
